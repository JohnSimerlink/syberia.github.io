        # Replace with actual code
        devtools::install_github("syberia")
        syberia::install_syberia()

    Now we can start creating a model!  Let's try to predict the chances of surviving the sinking of the RMS Titanic, via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">the Kaggle dataset</a>.
  %pre{class: "prettyprint "}
    = preserve do
      :escaped
        #TODO: ensure they're in the base directory
        cd models/dev
        mkdir titanic
        cd titanic
        #TODO: `yo syberia` or however we make the intial model file?
  %p
    Etc. More instructions helping them build the complete Titanic model... Blah.
