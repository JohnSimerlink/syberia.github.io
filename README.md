# syberia.io

The main page for Syberia, hosted by GitHub pages.

### Deployment

GitHub pages won't render markdown on their end, so we have to render it locally and deploy it ourselves.

Therefore, all development is done from the `source` branch and is "deployed" by pushing it to master through `bin/deploy`.
