<h1>Deployment</h1>

<p>Once you have a fully built model container, deploying it as
a REST service so you can serve predictions on the web is as
simple as calling <code class="inline">model$predict</code>
on your incoming stream of single row data points representing
customers, leads, emails, or whatever else you were modeling for.</p>

<p>The current release of the modeling engine does not include
deployment tools out-of-the-box, but it should be straightforward
for any engineering teams to build some using HTTP server
packages like <a href="https://github.com/robertzk/microserver">microserver</a>
or <a href="https://rforge.net/Rserve/">Rserve</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://syberia.io/roadmap">Syberia roadmap</a> to
learn when deployment tools will be released into the modeling
engine (or <a href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy/pulls">beat us to the punch!</a>).</p>
