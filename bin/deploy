## GitHub pages won't render markdown on their end.
## So we have to render it locally and deploy it ourselves.
## This is done from the `source` branch to the `master` branch.

rm -rf deploy/*
cp -r _site/* deploy/.
cd deploy
git add .
git commit -a -m "Site updated at `date`"
git push origin master --force
echo "Deploy complete!"
