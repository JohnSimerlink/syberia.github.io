<h1>Managing large projects</h1>

<p>Syberia comes bundled with <a href="https://github.com/syberia/director">director</a>, an R6
package aimed at simplifying management of large R projects.</p>

<p>By default, most R projects are collections of loosely organized scripts. A
newcomer to the project would have to rely on very thorough documentation to understand
how the executable tasks fit together and how to replicate and expand on any analysis.
Using notebooks like Jupyter just makes the problem worse: hard to inspect in code
reviews and encouraging messy watch-and-see-what-you-get scripting, notebooks
suck the developer right out of our analyst bones.</p>

<p>If you just want to roll up your sleeves and get to work, feel free to skip this
section and move on to <a href="">testing</a> (a software developer wrote this guide;
we won't let you skip testing!). A high-level understanding of how Syberia projects
manage stuff under the hood is helpful for expanding your horizon to more than
just the functionality packaged with the modeling engine.</p>

<p>In Syberia, we rely on <a href="">convention over configuration</a>, a common design
pattern in software frameworks that removes some leeway in the organizational structure
in exchange for something incredibly powerful: all R developers working in Syberia projects
will share common knowledge about how work is organized.</p>

<h2><a name="conventions">The modeling engine conventions</a></h2>

<p>In particular, the <a href="">modeling engine</a> that currently comes bundled as
the default engine for structured supervised learning projects such as regression and
classification sets up a few conventions which all modeling engine projects conform to:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li><p>The <b>models</b> directory holds all models for a given project. Each file is
  an R script that ends with a list object which hyper-parameterizes the
  data science process into a linear sequence of stages. All the conventions below are
  the recipe ingredients that turn model files from static lists to living, breathing
  objects defining a dynamic modeling pipeline.</p>
  <p>In the current modeling engine incarnation, these are <a href="">stagerunners</a>,
  R6 objects that tie together all aspects of the modeling process&mdash;but in the future
  we may release support for distributed backends and engines such as Spark or Tensorflow.
  Let's humbly learn how to walk before we run.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <b>lib/adapters</b> directory defines IO (input and output) mechanisms for data
  and serialized model objects. For example, data might be read in CSV format, from a
  database or data warehouse, or simply reside in-memory. Data and model objects may
  be written to a file, to a cloud storage service, or pushed via HTTP to an API.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <b>lib/mungebits</b> directory holds mungebits, already familiar from an
  earlier lesson, which define feature engineering templates that transform dataframes
  to dataframes. In the future, we may extend the notion of mungebits to distributed
  settings such as Spark, Tensorflow or Hadoop and even explore graphical or other 
  forms of data manipulation and computation&mdash;but development will stay nice and cozy within R.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <b>lib/stages</b> directory is a collection of modeling stages, by default
  <i>import</i>, <i>data</i>, <i>model</i>, and <i>export</i>. The complex logic that
  defines how to process the parameters in the modeling file lives in these stages: 
  each R file in this directory is a functional, a function that returns another function,
  namely, a function that takes in the parameters from the model file under the given stage key and spits out a
  transformation of an environment that performs the appropriate operations of the stage.</p>
  
  <p>For example, import stage may read from a CSV file whereas model stage may construct
  a <a href="">tundra container</a> and then call its predict method.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <b>lib/classifiers</b> directory is responsible for housing all the training and
  prediction functions for various statistical classifiers: linear regression, random forest,
  gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, et cetera. These are responsible for
  the construction of a <i> model object</i>, a serializable R object that represents all
  meta-data required to replicate the scoring of outputs on new validation sets or real-time
  data.</p></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Note that while in the current convention modeling remains in-memory and finitely bound,
this is not a given. If the syntax is sharp and compact, we may replace backends from
the current in-memory R approach to acting as a distributed command center for millions
of machines, but experimentation on local slices of the data can remain in one of the most
powerful interactive consoles we know: the R interpreter.</p>

<h2><a name="base">The base engine</a></h2>

<p>The above conventions are not exhaustive. Several are inherited from the parent engine
of the modeling engine: the base engine. The conventions established in the list below are defined by the
<a href="">base engine</a>, which is more general than the modeling engine and serves as the
clay for almost all future Syberia engines. In case you are wondering, do not worry, at the
present moment the topology is simple and linear: your project makes use of the modeling engine, which makes
use of the base engine, which relies on the Syberia package.</p>
<p>Future larger projects may
have complex intertwined engines for a variety of machine learning and business tasks, but
for the moment, once again, let us walk before we run.</p>
<p>For example, unsupervised learning, natural language processing, scientific research,
dashboarding and business intelligence, trading and finance, may all require different
conventions which differ somewhat or drastically from the structured supervised learning problem.
Building on top of the base engine allows for some very powerful meta-conventions:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>The <b>config/routes</b> resource (typically just a routes.R file) establishes the
  link between the <b>lib/controllers</b> directory and the rest of the project: it tethers
  together which directories are processed by which controllers.</li>
  <li><p>The <b>lib/controllers</b> directory forms the heart of Syberia's expansive
  configurability. In an effort to strike the balance between establishing conventions
  over configurations, whilst suitably recognizing that the taxonomy of
  <a href="">computing tasks</a> may require different conventions to optimally iterate
  on its given set of problems, the notion of a <i>controller</i> allows us to
  <i>generalize how R works</i>. In the old way, we would use <code class="inline">base::source</code>
  to execute an R file and store the value of its last expression in a local variable.</p>
  <p>Controllers allow us to define <i>preprocessors</i> and <i>parsers</i>. A preprocessor
  is a function that specifies everything <i>before</i> we execute an R file and a parser
  is a function that specifies everything <i>after</i> we execute an R file&mdash;in a 
  given directory. In effect, controllers allow us to establish heterogeneous DSLs
  (domain-specific languages) in a hierarchical directory structure in a way that
  most optimally conforms to how we wish to solve a particular problem, whether it be
  production-ready machine learning or experimental business intelligence dashboarding.</p>
  <p>The Syberia team looks forward to the creativity and imagination the R community
  will display when fully unlocking the power of controllers: let the domain-specific
  languages flood out the rigidity of CRAN and the constraints of packages, thus
  establishing R as a true player in the "general purpose programming language" 
  sector. It is, after all, just a LISP&mdash;a rather powerful one at that.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Philosophical asides beside, let's examine how a director object helps us 
generalize our thinking about R projects with some more concrete examples.</p>

<h2><a name="basic">The most basic director object</a></h2>

Let us start from the beginning and open a vanilla R session from the terminal:
<code class="inline">R --vanilla</code>.

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
devtools::install_github("syberia/director") # Install director into the global library.
library(director)
dir <- tempdir()
project <- director(dir)
project # Director object monitoring 'temporary director'.
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>We have in our hands a director object! Note the <code class="inline">class(project)</code>.
Under the hood, Syberia manages the creation of a director object when your R session
starts and <code class="inline">syberia::syberia_project()</code> is called: this last 
expression returns a <code class="inline">syberia_engine</code> R6 object which inherits
from the <code class="inline">director</code> R6 class and expands on the vanilla functionalities
of a director object.</p>

<p>Let's see what our object can do: <code class="inline">ls(project)</code>. The noteworthy
methods are <code class="inline">exists, filename, find, root</code> and
<code class="inline">resource</code>.</p>

<p>Let's create an R file in our temporary project and see what happens.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
# Write "cat('Hello world!')" into hello.R at the root of the project.
# You can also do this using a text editor.
# Note: `project$root()` is equivalent to `dir` from earlier, if not a little clearer.
writeLines("cat('Hello world!')", file.path(project$root(), "hello.R"))
# Our project now recognizes hello.R as a "hello" resource.
project$find() # [1] "hello"
# Executing the resource gives us what we expect.
project$resource("hello") # Hello world!NULL
# We have a NULL at the end the return value of the cat function is NULL.
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>By default, the <code class="inline">resource</code> method acts as a slightly more
powerful <code class="inline">source</code>.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
devtools::install_github("robertzk/Ramd") # Install the Ramd package for the 'define' helper.
# Create dir/world
dir.create(file.path(project$root(), "world"))
# Write to dir/world/world.R
writeLines("Ramd::define('hello', function(hello) { cat(hello, 'world!') })",
           file.path(project$root(), "world", "world.R"))
writeLines("'hello'", file.path(project$root(), "world", "hello.R"))
project$find() # [1] "world" "hello"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Note that <code class="inline">find</code> does not produce results in alphabetical
order. The resources are ordered by which ones were modified most recently.</p>

<p>In the above example, we illustrated one of the most powerful concepts in
director: <b>idempotent resources</b>. Many dynamic scripting languages like JavaScript
or R have found themselves at the forefront of popular usage without 
the language designer anticipating their growth in complexity. In R projects,
we typically find it hard to organize our work sometimes because, like JavaScript,
R was simply not designed with large architectures in mind.</p>

<p>However, there is a neat solution. We take a page out of the books of
<a href="">require.js</a> and node.js and allow each director object a very
specific convention: if a file (ignoring extension) has the same name as its
parent directory, it gets treated as an idempotent resource, meaning that
the other files in that directory are <b>helper files</b> which become invisible
to the director object.</p>

<p>These helper files are implicitly understood to be available
to the main file for its final construction, but otherwise should not be
treated as Syberia resources, that is, should not be made available as modular
pieces for re-use within the rest of the project. If you find yourself
needing to make use of them, it is a good indication that they deserve
the title of their own distinct resource.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
list.files(project$root(), recursive = TRUE)
# "hello.R"       "world/hello.R" "world/world.R"
project$filename("world")
# [1] "world/world.R"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>The director object keeps track of the fact that the "world" resource
is in fact at "world/world.R". This is a virtual construction which maps
either to "world.R" or "world/world.R" depending on the name of the parent
directory of "world.R".</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
project$resource("world")
# hello world!NULL
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Our resource has been pieced together from the world directory using
both "world/hello.R" and "world/world.R".</p>

<p>The usage of the Ramd package was for the <code class="inline">Ramd::define</code>
function, which allows a convenient syntax for sourcing adjacent files. Note
these files are truly <i>sourced</i> using <code class="inline">base::source</code>
and are pure helper R scripts&mdash;they do not benefit from the preprocessor
or parser magic in director that we are about to introduce! (This is a frequent
source of bizarre bugs and stack traces and merits explicit mention.)</p>

<h2><a name="preprocessor">Preprocessors and parsers</a></h2>

<p>Continuing with the example from the previous section, let's add some flair
to our project.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
john <- utils::person("John", "Doe")
john # "John Doe"
class(john) # "person"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>We use the simplest illustrative structure we know of: the utils package's
definition of a <code class="inline">person</code> S3 class. Imagine we
want to define a convention that all files in the "people" directory
must return a <code class="inline">c("first name", "last name")</code> 
character vector and create a person object. It would be annoying and
repetitive to write <code class="inline">utils::person("first name", "last name")</code>
in each file, and anyway we may wish to replace the base definition with another
class down the road. (See <a href="">don't repeat yourself</a>.)</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
dir.create(file.path(project$root(), "people"))
writeLines('c("Jane", "Smith")', file.path(project$root(), "people/jane.R"))
jane <- project$resource("people/jane")
jane # [1] "Jane" "Smith"
class(jane) # "character"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>So far, we have not accomplished our objective: <code class="inline">jane</code>
is still a lowly character vector, not a <code class="inline">person</code>.
To animate her like Pinnocchio, we shall define a parser on the director object.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
project$register_parser("people", function(output) {
  do.call(utils::person, as.list(unname(output)))
})
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Now let's try again.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
jane <- project$resource("people/jane")
jane # [1] "Jane Smith"
class(jane) # "person"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>What a lovely lady <code class="inline">jane</code> now has become! By
calling <code class="inline">register_parser</code> on the <code class="inline">project</code>,
we have implicitly told our director to, going forward, treat all
files in the "people" directory with the convention: take the output
of the file and pass it as arguments to <code class="inline">utils::person</code>.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
dir.create(file.path(project$root(), "people", "maryjane"))
writeLines("mary &lt;- 'Mary'; jane &lt;- 'Jane'; paste(mary, jane, sep = '-')",
           file.path(project$root(), "people", "maryjane", "mj.R"))
writeLines("Ramd::define('mj', function(mj) { c(mj, 'Jones') })",
           file.path(project$root(), "people", "maryjane", "maryjane.R"))
maryjane &lt;- project$resource("people/maryjane")
maryjane # [1] "Mary-Jane Jones"
class(maryjane) # "person"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see, <code class="inline">maryjane</code> is more complex than
<code class="inline">mary</code>, but she is still a great example of a
<code class="inline">person</code>.</p>

<p>So far, we have encountered an example of a parser. We can also do additional
work before sourcing the file, such as injecting helper functions (maybe even
recursively composed of other Syberia resources.)</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
project$register_preprocessor("people", function(source_env, source) {
  source_env$capitalize <- function(x) {
    x <- strsplit(x, "")[[1]]
    paste(c(toupper(x[1]), tolower(x[-1])), collapse = "")
  }
  source()
})
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>We can now use the <code class="inline">capitalize</code> helper in
files in the "people" directory.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
writeLines("sapply(c('jimmy', 'JOHNSON'), capitalize)",
           file.path(project$root(), "people", "jimmy.R"))
jimmy &lt;- project$resource("people/jimmy")
jimmy # [1] "Jimmy Johnson"
class(jimmy) # "person"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Before Hadley Wickham pops out of thin air to remind you never to use
<code class="inline">sapply</code>, note that we never defined
<code class="inline">capitalize</code> anywhere in the file: it got injected
by the preprocessor.</p>

<p>The full list of magic provided by the preprocessor and parser
definitions is listed in the appendix. The Syberia base engine (the
foundation for the modeling engine) provides conventions that bootstrap
a vanilla <code class="inline">director</code> object into providing
some very basic conventions: everything in "lib/controllers" allows
us some shortcuts for calling <code class="inline">project$register_preprocessor</code>
and <code class="inline">project$register_parser</code> under the hood.</p>

<p>In other words, Syberia uses director recursively to bootstrap the definition
of "controllers" into existence: even controllers are just another Syberia
resource and can be rewritten at will; and even <code class="inline">director</code>
objects can be replaced with more powerful tools for managing R projects.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
cat("I know of these people:", paste(collapse = ", ", project$find("people")), "\n")
# I know of these people:  people/jimmy, people/maryjane, people/jane
vapply(project$find("people"), function(p) { as.character(project$resource(p)) }, "")
#      people/jimmy   people/maryjane       people/jane
#   "Jimmy Johnson" "Mary-Jane Jones"      "Jane Smith"
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<h2><a name="additional">Additional director functionality</a></h2>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
# By default, `find` matches using fuzzy wildcard and is equivalent to
# the regex: .*p.*.p.*l.*
project$find("ppl") # [1] "people/jimmy"    "people/maryjane" "people/jane"
# This is mostly because the author is lazy and likes convenience. Feel
# free to suggest a change in a pull request or issue in the director package.
# You can target just subdirectories:
project$find("ppl", method = "partial") # character(0)
project$find("people", method = "partial") # [1] "people/jimmy"    "people/maryjane" "people/jane"
# You can also target for an exact match, at most one result.
project$find("people", method = "exact") # character(0)
project$find("people/jimmy", method = "exact") # [1] "people/jimmy"

# You can use `filename` to discover the filename behind a resource.
unname(vapply(project$find("people"), project$filename, character(1)))
# [1] "people/jimmy.R" "people/maryjane/maryjane.R" "people/jane.R"

# You can use `exists` to check for resource existence.
project$exists("people/jimmy") # [1] TRUE
project$exists("people/jimmyjohns") # [1] FALSE
    </span></code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Some additional more advanced functionality is provided by the
<code class="inline">syberia_engine</code> object which extends the <code class="inline">director</code>
object but that is beyond the scope of this introduction. It involves handling
all communication and coordination between the root project and its
dependent engines, in addition to locating resources across the topology
of engines mounted to the root project. If all that sounds complicated,
that's because it is, so don't worry about it for now.</p>

<h2>How director interacts with your project</h2>

<p>Under the hood, you don't have to worry about most of the explicit
examples in this chapter. The Syberia modeling engine handles almost
all uses of director objects under the hood. The only real usage 
you should remember is to call <code class="inline">project$resource("foo")</code>
when you want to call resource "foo" (e.g., "models/model1", "lib/mungebits/imputer", et cetera).</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">project</code> global helper is just a 
shortcut for <code class="inline">syberia::syberia_project()</code>, which
builds your project from the current working directory into a <code class="inline">syberia_engine</code>
R6 object and then memoizes (caches) it in memory.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>You are so close! You can skip straight to the summary, but any great
aspiring developer will read the section on testing.</p>
