<h1>Download</h1>

<p>
First, make sure you have <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/">installed R</a>.
Downloading Syberia into a sandbox that does not interfere with your usual
R package library can be done by running the minimal example project:
</p>
<br />

<div class="code shell">
  <pre>
# Run this from your command line terminal.
git clone git@github.com:syberia/example.sy.git && cd example.sy && R
  </pre>
</div>

<br />
<p>If you are having trouble, scroll down to the <a href="#trouble">troubleshooting</a>
section.</p> After the packages have downloaded and your R session opens 
type

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
run("example")
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>If everything worked correctly, you should see some model predictions.  </p>
