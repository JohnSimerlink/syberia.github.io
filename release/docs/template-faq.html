<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What about &#9835;Big Data&#9835;?</h2>

<p>What about it? As my thesis advisor said "understanding mathematics is not
about complex abstract ideas, but about understanding <i>simple things well</i>."
If you worry the size of your data is the problem, you are probably not taking
the correct approach to a solution. At <a href="https://data.avant.com">Avant</a>,
we regularly use Syberia to turn our problems into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a>
work units or use Syberia to call out to distributed C++ code that has already solved the
problem.

<p>Syberia acts as a rapid syntactic scaffolding tool to avoid being
slowed down by compiling JAR files or submitting DAGs to distributed job runners:
debugging those things will be pretty painful even with a stack trace.
It's much nicer staying in a responsive REPL that keeps you feeling fresh and iterating
quickly.</p>

<p>While we are not ready to share our solutions to these problems, we
promise that putting syntax <i>first</i>, like a mathematician, will lead
to great things. There is a good reason why the 
<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/03/25/define-first-prove-later/">definitions are hard</a>
and the theorems are easy. Solve the problem of fitting thousands of 
models to radically different academic and business questions with a
succint high-level parametrization of the full modeling process, and
we promise &#9835;Big Data&#9835; will be an easy final step.</p>
