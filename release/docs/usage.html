<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Ensure you have <a href="download.html">set up Syberia</a>
prior to proceeding.</p>

<p>Syberia is a meta-framework: it allows you to build <b>engines</b>
which form the basis of your R projects. If your project consists
primarily of machine learning projects you intend to push to a
production system, use the
<a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy">modeling engine</a>.
</p>

<p>
If it consists primarily of visualization dashboards, you will
learn how to modularize your code to make the process of building
dashboards faster and then pull it out into a dashboard engine 
for future projects. Almost any project has abstractions lurking
around the corner that will help you with similar future projects.
</p>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, we will focus our efforts on the <b>modeling engine</b>.</p>

<h2>Running a model</h2>

<p>Recall our command from earlier.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
run("example")
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>This command executed the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/example.sy/blob/master/models/dev/example1.R">model file</a>
"models/dev/example1":</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
list(
  import = list(R = "iris"),
  data   = list(
    "Create dep var" = list(renamer, c("Sepal.Length" = "dep_var")),
    "Create ID var"  = list(multi_column_transformation(seq_along), "dep_var", "id")
  ),
  model  = list("lm", .id_var = "id"),
  export = list(R = "model")
)
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Let's briefly traverse through what happened:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    When the modeling engine loaded, it attached some
    <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy/blob/master/config/global/modeling/modeling.R">global helpers</a>
    through the <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy/blob/master/config/boot.R">boot file</a>
    to make it easier to experiment in the console. One of these
    was <code class="inline">run</code>.
  </li>

  <li>
    The <code class="inline">run</code> function found the closest matching model,
    in this case "models/dev/example1", using fuzzy matching (so <code class="inline">example</code>
    really means the regular expression <code class="inline">.*e.*x.*a.*m.*p.*l.*e.*</code>, that
    is, any instance of an "e" followed by some characters and then an "x" followed by
    some letters and then an "a", etc.).
  </li>

  <li>
    The underlying <code class="inline">syberia_engine</code> object "compiled" the resource.
    Note the local variable <code class="inline">renamer</code> in the model file: it 
    is not actually defined anywhere! As we'll see later, the models controller has injected
    it for us. It is possible to define and parametrize new feature engineering on the fly
    and the models controller will automatically inject your helpers. We'll go into
    that and more on controllers down the road.
  </li>
  <li>
    In this case, the final "compiled" resource is a 
    <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/stagerunner">stagerunner</a>,
    an object capable of tracking our progress in the modeling pipeline from start to finish.
    If during later munging or model training we noticed a typo in the parameters to
    <code class="inline">renamer</code>,
    we could halt execution, fix the typo, and type <code class="inline">run(, "2/1")</code>,
    meaning "re-run the first substage of the second stage of the last executed model." Then
    we could finish the model using <code class="inline">run(, "2/2", "export")</code>
    ("run from 'Create ID var' to 'export'") without losing our work or having to start
    from scratch with the raw data. More on this later.
  </li>
  <li>
    The compiled stagerunner is using a method called <code class="inline">$run</code> to
    execute the stages we're asking for. The result of calling the method is a list of 
    two environments, <code class="inline">before</code> and <code class="inline">after</code>,
    one representing what existed prior to running the step and the other what the result
    was afterward. Go ahead and try comparing <code class="inline">ls(run(, "2/1")$before$data)</code>
    and <code class="inline">ls(run(, "2/1")$after$data)</code>. Do you notice the column
    names changing? The modeling engine mounts shortcuts for inspecting data before and
    after the last run, so this is equivalent to <code class="inline">ls(B)</code> and
    <code class="inline">ls(A)</code>, respectively. Try it! Having easy interactive access
    to the data before and after munging is intended to speed up the feature 
    engineering inspection and debugging process, typically a cumbersome component of
    data science.
  </li>
  <li>
    The keys of the list, <code class="inline">c("import", "data", "model", "export")</code>,
    were stitched together through <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/syberia/modeling.sy/tree/master/lib/stages">stages</a>
    by the models controller. The modeling engine comes with those four pre-built stages
    but it is trivial to extend them or define more if you're doing visualization, report generation,
    more impressive ensemble or stack pipelines, and any other tasks. Under the hood,
    think of the stagerunner as executing a chain of functions operating on a <b>context</b>,
    a designated R environment object for playing with all the objects necessary to
    complete the modeling process. Later, it will be possible to generalize the interactive
    Syberia approach to arbitrary DAG (directed acyclic graph) runners.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the run has completed, the last stage <code class="inline">export = list(R = "model")</code>
    says "export the model to this R session" under the global variable <code class="inline">model</code>.
    Both the import and export stages are fully customizable if we want to read the
    data from or write the model to a variety of backends.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After running the model (i.e., the full modeling pipeline) we have a 
ready-to-deploy model object. We call this
object <b>deployable</b> because it has everything it needs to replicate both the
feature engineering pipeline and the final score prediction on a single
row of streaming data, and it is trivial to
<a target="_new" href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/readRDS.html">serialize</a>.</p>

<p>If the model was predicting the probability a user
will click on a link from a very raw, unclean dataset, we could send the
raw 1-row dataset for a new user to a simple server that called <code class="inline">model$predict(one_row)</code>
and returned the final score. The model object takes care of reproducing
the entire data pipeline on the single row of data through <b>mungebits</b>.</p>

<p>The end goal of the Syberia modeling engine is to make the process of building
any model, no matter how complex or stacked or multi-staged, the rather trivial
combination of pre-built modular and testable units yielding an object that can execute the
entire streaming prediction, from assembling raw data sets to producing final scores: 
we want to see <a target="_new" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">CRAN</a>
come alive.</p>
