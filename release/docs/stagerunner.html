<h1>Stagerunner</h1>

<p>Experimenting with a data science task is usually done through
the R console or an IDE by executing portions of a file
or collection of files. Sometimes this is slightly generalized
into notebooks, interactive sessions that record the
history of the code you executed and its outputs, 
including plots, data, and summaries.</p>

<p>This kind of workflow works well in the old way, when
you don't intend on returning to your analysis for any
future use and are happy with a static image result.</p>

<p>Developers working on pure software engineering projects
usually operate in a different way: they manipulate a single
codebase and provide iterability and experimentability through
some other approach that ultimately ends up reflecting what's
in their codebase.</p>

<p>For example, a front-end web developer might change a
JavaScript file in the deep innards of a web app, hit refresh
on their browser, and test out the new functionality by clicking
their mouse.</p>

<p>To achieve a better data science workflow we will mirror
the effectiveness of the typical developer approach. 
We will rely on a <i>shared codebase</i> composed of
modular and testable resources that allows us to go back
in time using version control and have new components
vetted using code review.</p>

<p>Let's try putting the pieces of the codebase together into
a living breathing object, the same way a web browser brings a
web application alive. We'll start with a stagerunner but in
the future may end up with much more.</p>
