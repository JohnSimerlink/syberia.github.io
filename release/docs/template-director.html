<h1>Managing large projects</h1>

<p>Syberia comes bundled with <a href="https://github.com/syberia/director">director</a>, an R6
package aimed at simplifying management of large R projects.</p>

<p>By default, most R projects are collections of loosely organized scripts. A
newcomer to the project would have to rely on very thorough documentation to understand
how the executable tasks fit together and how to replicate and expand on any analysis.</p>

<p>In Syberia, we rely on <a href="">convention over configuration</a>, a common design
pattern in software frameworks that removes some leeway in the organizational structure
in exchange for something incredibly powerful: all R developers working in Syberia projects
will share common knowledge about how work is organized.</p>

<p>In particular, the <a href="">modeling engine</a> that currently comes bundled as
the default engine for structured supervised learning projects such as regression and
classification sets up a few conventions which all modeling engine projects conform to:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>The <b>lib/adapters</b> directory defines </li>
</ul></p>
