<p>Machine learning looks initially like the science of 
devising and answering pure statistical questions on real-life data sets.
In practice, a lot of it ends up being

</p>

<p>Turning the data cleaning and feature engineering process into
a quick workflow and as pleasant a task as trying out different modeling methodologies 
will eventually address this problem.</p>

<p> Let's restrict
the discussion to transforming one messy, raw dataset into a 
clean, ready-to-model dataset. Parsing and merging of data is not
typically R's forte so we will solve the single dataset problem
before proceeding with more complicated cleaning topologies.</p>

<p>The initial abstraction offered by the Syberia modeling engine is that
of <b>mungebits</b>: atomic production-ready feature engineering templates
that can be used to quickly clean a dataset without having to write
separate code when it comes time to replicate the cleaning process
on single rows of data.</p>

<p>Why would we want to replicate the entire process? That's precisely
one of the difficulties that emerges when it comes time to "productionize"
the model! The trained classifier expects a certain type of covariate matrix,
namely the one in exactly the preprocessed format you generated by cleaning
the data set.</p>

<p>But why would we want to think about "productionizing" right away
when we are experimenting? Because lack of due consideration there
is the primary obstacle leading to weeks or months long error-prone
translation processes when turning an experimental result into one
that can be applied on new data in the real world.</p>

<p>It's worth investing a little bit more time now instead of far more time later
when we have to replicate the cleaning work on new data. Note this 
does not just apply to streaming systems! If someone gave you a new
validation set from their data warehouse and asked to verify the
performance on some new data points it would be equivalent to
solving the streaming problem: we would have to replicate the entire
cleaning process on the raw validation set.
</p>

<p>For example, if you replaced messed up values with the correct
values, imputed missing values, dropped certain columns, or derived some
new features from the existing data, you will have to re-do that work
when a single data point comes in--otherwise the trained classifier
will be confused.</p>

<p>Operations that take one data.frame and return another data.frame come
in two types: <i>narrow</i> and <i>wide</i> transformations. You can
delegate the <i>narrow</i> transformations to an ETL engineer or other
data curation role. However, this might not be feasible, because they will
have to provide a way to replicate their
