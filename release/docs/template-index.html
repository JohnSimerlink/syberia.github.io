        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Let's get you up and running with Syberia!</p>

        <p>Before we get started, let's take a look at what a classifier might
           look like using the Syberia modeling engine:</p>
        <div class="code">
          <pre>
            <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
list(
  import = list(
    # For this simple example, we'll use Kaggle's example Titanic data set.
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haven-jeon/introduction_to_most_usable_pkgs_in_project/master/bicdata/data/titanic.csv"
  ),

  data = list(
    "Factor to character"  = list(column_transformation(as.character), is.factor)
  , "fare_title"           = list(multi_column_transformation(function(title, fare) { ave(fare, title, FUN = mean) }), c("title", "fare"), "title_fare")
  , "Name length variable" = list(new_variable, function(name) nchar(name), "name_length")
  , "Set factors"          = list(column_transformation(factor), c("sex", "embarked"))
  , "Restore levels"       = list(restore_categorical_variables)
  , "Rename dep_var"       = list(renamer, c("survived" = "dep_var"))
  ),

  model = list(
      "gbm"
    , .id_var             = "X"
    , distribution        = "bernoulli"
    , number_of_trees     = 3000
    , shrinkage_factor    = 0.005
    , depth               = 5
    , min_observations    = 6
    , train_fraction      = 1
    , bag_fraction        = 0.5
    , cv                  = TRUE
    , cv_folds            = 5
    , number_of_cores     = 4
    , perf_method         = "cv"
    , prediction_type     = "response"
  ),

  export = list(
    R    = "titanic_model"         # Export the model object to a global variable.
# , s3   = "some/path/titanic-1"   # It's also possible to export to Amazon's S3. 
# , file = "~/some/path/titanic-1" # Or a file...
                                   # Or any other custom export format you define.
  )
)
            </span></code>
          </pre>
        </div>

        <p>This incredibly simple example showcases the primary principle behind
           the Syberia approach to modeling. Instead of separating the modeling
           process into a collection of scripts, every model constructed in
           Syberia should take raw production data to a complete ready-to-deploy
           object in an easily readable short format that describes the
           most important components of the modeling process.</p>

        <p>Behind the scenes, Syberia constructs an object that allows you to
           "roll back" to earlier points in time without repeating previous steps
           in case something went wrong, such as when you're debugging or testing
           your feature engineering. Keeping track of temporary variables and re-importing
           when you made a mistake can be a cumbersome component of a script-driven
           or notebook-driven workflow.</p>

        <p>With Syberia, the approach to modeling is the same as the software
           engineering approach to development: your work should be testable, modular,
           and each component you build should have a clear purpose. In the example
           above, we will see how the high-level file is an end-to-end parametrization
           of the modeling process that breaks down to constructs like I/O adapters,
           feature engineering <strong>mungebits</strong>, exportable classifiers,
           and re-runnable stagerunners that achieve a space/time tradeoff to allow
           you to quickly roll back to halfway through your workflow and experiment
           with different parameters.</p>

           <p>The current use case of Syberia is rapidly experimenting with different machine
           learning classifiers and producing deployable model objects so that you do not have to recode
           your work into Python, Ruby, C++ or Java. Many statisticians and academics have
           worked hard to produce a flourishing ecosystem of statistical and machine learning
           methods in R and we think their work belongs in the real world without
           laborious translation efforts.</p>

        <p>The long-term vision for Syberia is to act
           as a tool for rapidly constructing DSLs (domain-specific languages) to
           solve problems in a variety of domains: constructing visualization dashboards,
           performing business intelligence and summarization work, conducting reproducible
           research, and acting as a command center for all big data frameworks.</p>
