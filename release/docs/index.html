        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>Let's get you up and running with Syberia!</p>

        <p>If you already know what Syberia is and what you can do it with it, feel free to
        skip to the next <a href="#example">subsection</a>. Otherwise, hopefully this
        brief section will answer some questions.</p>

        <p>Will Syberia help me if I am trying to <b>productionize data science models</b>?
        Yes, but primarily if those models are written in R.
        Syberia is a framework designed specifically to productionize the R
        programming language with rapid iteration cycles, although hybrid models
        consisting of Python, Scala, and other tools are also possible to deploy.</p>

        <p>Will Syberia help me if I am trying to <b>quantitatively understand a business question</b>?
        While not its primary design, the packages that compose Syberia can be
        used to augment interactive data analysis and introduce the benefits
        of solid developer hygiene such as testability and modularity.</p>

        <p>Will Syberia help me if I am <b>solving an academic problem</b>? 
        Syberia was designed in an industry context but is general enough to be
        useful for other domains, including academia. Although no out-of-the-box 
        Syberia engine currently exists for reproducible research and publication,
        this is a possible path to explore for the future.</p>

        <p>What if I need to solve a <b>big data problem</b> or <b>deploy low latency
          machine learning models</b>? Syberia is designed to act as a command
        center for all data science problems and eventually interact smoothly
        with high-performance and large-size data requirements. Currently, you
        should expect to be able to productionize any R code (10-1000ms latency SLAs on data
        problems with inputs of millions of rows and hundreds of features).
        </p>

        <p>What about <b>dashboards</b>? <b>Unstructured or audiovisual data</b>? <b>Deep 
          learning</b>? The world is at your feet but you will have to do some
        custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface" target="_new">FFI</a> work.
        For the current alpha release, productionization of medium-size structured data
        problems is supported out-of-the-box.</p>

        <h2><a name="example">An example</a></h2>

        <p>Before we get started, let's take a look at what a classifier might
           look like using the Syberia modeling engine:</p>
        <div class="code">
          <pre>
            <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
list( # R's a LISP, so we represent the modeling process with a list. :)
  import = list(
    # For this simple example, we'll use Kaggle's example Titanic data set.
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haven-jeon/introduction_to_most_usable_pkgs_in_project/master/bicdata/data/titanic.csv"
  ), # You can use a variety of data import adapters, like csv or AWS's S3.

  data = list(
    "Factor to character"  = list(column_transformation(as.character), is.factor)
    # One line per feature engineering step seems undue, but it's for a
    # good cause: commenting out to try with and without a step is trivial,
    # and as the parametrization grows longer it's a clear indication
    # you need a new mungebit!
  , "fare_title"           = list(multi_column_transformation(function(title, fare) { ave(fare, title, FUN = mean) }), c("title", "fare"), "title_fare")
  , "Name length variable" = list(new_variable, function(name) nchar(name), "name_length")
  , "Set factors"          = list(column_transformation(factor), c("sex", "embarked"))
  , "Restore levels"       = list(restore_categorical_variables)
  , "Rename dep_var"       = list(renamer, c("survived" = "dep_var"))
  ), # Giving a short summary of each step will come in handy later.

  model = list(
      "gbm" # The name of our classifier. This is defined elsewhere.
    , .id_var             = "X"
    , distribution        = "bernoulli" # And some parameters.
    , number_of_trees     = 3000        # Here we try a binary classification.
    , shrinkage_factor    = 0.005
    , depth               = 5
    , min_observations    = 6
    , train_fraction      = 1
    , bag_fraction        = 0.5
    , cv                  = TRUE
    , cv_folds            = 5
    , number_of_cores     = 4
    , perf_method         = "cv"
    , prediction_type     = "response"
  ),

  export = list( # Exporting the model is done in 1 line of code.
    R    = "titanic_model"  # Export the model object to a global variable.
# , s3   = "path/titanic"   # It's also possible to export to Amazon's S3. 
# , file = "~/path/titanic" # Or a file...
                            # Or any other custom export format you define.
  )
)
            </span></code>
          </pre>
        </div>

        <p>This incredibly simple example showcases the primary principle behind
           the Syberia approach to modeling. Instead of separating the modeling
           process into a collection of scripts, every model constructed in
           Syberia should take raw production data to a complete ready-to-deploy
           object in an easily readable short format that describes the
           most important components of the modeling process.</p>

        <p>Behind the scenes, Syberia constructs an object that allows you to
           "roll back" to earlier points in time without repeating previous steps
           in case something went wrong, such as when you're debugging or testing
           your feature engineering. Keeping track of temporary variables and re-importing
           when you made a mistake can be a cumbersome component of a script-driven
           or notebook-driven workflow.</p>

        <p>With Syberia, the approach to modeling is the same as the software
           engineering approach to development: your work should be testable, modular,
           and each component you build should have a clear purpose. In the example
           above, we will see how the high-level file is an end-to-end parametrization
           of the modeling process that breaks down to constructs like I/O adapters,
           feature engineering <strong>mungebits</strong>, exportable classifiers,
           and re-runnable stagerunners that achieve a space/time tradeoff to allow
           you to quickly roll back to halfway through your workflow and experiment
           with different parameters.</p>

           <p>The current use case of Syberia is rapidly experimenting with different
           feature engineering steps and machine
           learning classifiers and producing deployable model objects so that you do not have to recode
           your work into Python, Ruby, C++ or Java. Many statisticians and academics have
           worked hard to produce a flourishing ecosystem of statistical and machine learning
           methods in R and we think their work belongs in the real world without
           laborious translation efforts.</p>

        <p>The long-term vision for Syberia is to act
           as a tool for rapidly constructing DSLs (domain-specific languages) to
           solve problems in a variety of domains: constructing visualization dashboards,
           performing business intelligence and summarization work, conducting reproducible
           research, and acting as a command center for all big data frameworks.</p>
