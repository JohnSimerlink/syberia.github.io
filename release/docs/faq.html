<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What about &#9835;Big Data&#9835;?</h2>

<p>What about it? As my thesis advisor said "understanding mathematics is not
about complex abstract ideas, but about understanding <i>simple things well</i>."
If you worry the size of your data is the problem, you are probably not taking
the correct approach to a solution. At <a href="https://data.avant.com">Avant</a>,
we regularly use Syberia to turn our problems into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a>
work units or use Syberia to call out to distributed C++ code that has already solved the
problem.

<p>Syberia acts as a rapid syntactic scaffolding tool to avoid being
slowed down by compiling JAR files or submitting DAGs to distributed job runners:
debugging those things will be pretty painful even with a stack trace.
It's much nicer staying in a responsive REPL that keeps you feeling fresh and iterating
quickly.</p>

<p>While we are not ready to share our solutions to these problems, we
promise that putting syntax <i>first</i>, like a mathematician, will lead
to great things. There is a good reason why the 
<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2015/03/25/define-first-prove-later/">definitions are hard</a>
and the theorems are easy. Solve the problem of fitting and daily re-deploying
thousands of feature engineering pipelines and ML models in response to radically
different academic and business questions with a
succint high-level parametrization of the full modeling process while
maintaining full end-to-end testability, modularity, continuous integration,
and zero-code deployment over every model you have ever experimentally created, and
we promise that &#9835;Big Data&#9835; will be an easy final step.</p> 

<p>Otherwise we'll give you your money back.</p>

<h2>How do I deploy my model?</h2>

<p>This is a question for your devops engineer. While we are not ready to share
our solutions to these problems, there are plenty of approaches already. The
Syberia modeling engine builds you a model object that is easily 
<a target="_new" href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/readRDS.html">serializable</a>.
If you can park it on some persistent storage and read it in dynamically, just
write a 10-line web server that takes a JSON hash of the rawest, messiest
production data you can give it, turns it into a 1-row data.frame (don't forget
to let <b>mungebits</b> do all the hard munging work to avoid hardcoding in
aspects of the feature engineering process), and calls</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre>
    <code class="R"><span class="spacer">
send_back_json_response(list(score = model$predict(one_row_of_data)))
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>

<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/robertzk/microserver">microserver</a>,
<a href="https://rforge.net/Rserve/">Rserve</a>, or bake the R run-time into
a simple C server. The sky is the limit. <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a>
might help.</p>

<h2>But R is slow</h2>

<p>That's not a question. Syberia's original use case was to deploy very complicated
topologies of models, with one feeding into another which ensembles with a third
which finally feeds into a fourth, and deploying the solution without having to
write a single extra line of code. If you can't tolerate a couple dozen milliseconds
of latency, or a couple hundred for the more complex data science products,
then I guess you have no recourse but to re-write your hard work in C.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could transpile the current modeling engine DSL to C just-in-time.</p>

<p>This is actually not that hard. You'll get to keep your fast iteration speed but 
the recipe requires a few C gurus to maintain the mapping.</p>
