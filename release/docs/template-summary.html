<h1>Summary and review</h1>

<p>In this guide, we have worked our way through all the features
of the Syberia modeling engine. Hopefully you have a better idea of
the tools the engine provides you and are ready to do some
modeling work. As the Syberia ecosystem matures, we hope to
have more guides for other engines that simplify the various
domains of expertise covered by R and CRAN.</p>
