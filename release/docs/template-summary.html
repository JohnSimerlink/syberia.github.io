<h1>Summary and review</h1>

<p>In this guide, we have worked our way through all the high-level features
of the Syberia modeling engine. Hopefully you have a better idea of
the tools the engine provides and are ready to do some
modeling work. As the Syberia ecosystem matures, we hope to
provide more guides for other yet-to-be-built engines that simplify the various
domains of expertise covered by R and CRAN.</p>
