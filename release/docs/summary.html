<h1>Summary and review</h1>

<p>In this guide, we have worked our way through all the high-level features
of the Syberia modeling engine. Hopefully you have a better idea of
the tools the engine provides and are ready to do some
modeling work. As the Syberia ecosystem matures, we hope to
provide more guides for other yet-to-be-built engines that simplify the various
domains of expertise covered by R and CRAN.</p>

<p>The modeling engine provides basic capabilities for the following
simplified workflow.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Importing data sets from arbitrary sources.</li>
<li>Cleaning the data by picking the relevant parameters for mungebits.</li>
<li>Applying a statistical method to the cleaned data.</li>
<li>Exporting the model object to a persistent storage layer for later use.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Note that validation and cross-validation are not built into this workflow
but can be incorporated through additional tools and functions. Each model and
academic or business question may require its own validation strategy, 
so simple tools like AUC and classification error may not be sufficient. However,
the final model object should be sufficient for validating on out-of-sample data
and can be used to tune the parameters laid out earlier in the process.</p>

<h2>The modeling engine</h2>

<p>Armed with the <a href="">example modeling project</a>, we learned that
the modeling engine gives us the power to:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>The <b>lib/adapters</b> directory for importing and exporting R objects such
  as data and model objects. Files here should contain <code class="inline">write</code>
  and <code class="inline">read</code> variables providing functions for reading and
  writing R objects in the desired format.</li>
<li>The <b>lib/mungebits</b> directory for defining feature engineering templates.
  These files should have a <code class="inline">train</code> and
  <code class="inline">predict</code> variable giving the function that
  must be used during training versus validation and production, respectively.</li>
<li>The <b>lib/stages</b> directory for specifying custom stages. By default,
  the modeling engine comes bundled with <i>import</i>, <i>data</i>, <i>model</i>,
  and <i>export</i> stage. Typically you won't need to touch this until more
  advanced functionality is required in your modeling projects.</li>
<li>The <b>lib/classifiers</b> directory for specifying statistical methods
  on cleaned data sets. Files here come with a <code class="inline">train</code>
  and <code class="inline">predict</code> variable just like in mungebits, except
  that the arguments have different meanings.</li>
<li><p>The <b>models</b> directory ties everything together. By loose convention,
  models in development should be placed in <b>models/dev</b> and models in
  production (or finalized for other business uses or publication) should be placed
  in <b>models/prod</b>.</p>
  <p>Files in the models directory follow the grammar specified throughout this
  guide. The last expression in each model file should be a static list object
  with keys <code class="inline">c("import", "data", "model", "export")</code>
  outlining the hyper-parameters for the end-to-end modeling process. Calling
  <code class="inline">project$resource</code> on a model resource produces
  a stagerunner R6 object.</p></li>
