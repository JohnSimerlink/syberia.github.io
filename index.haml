      Build predictive models faster than ever before.
    %p
      <strong>Syberia</strong> is a framework for quickly trying different methods in data science.  Syberia supports building, debugging, testing, and deploying classifiers developed in R.
    %p
      Syberia includes support for importing data, preparing data, multiple statistical modeling methodologies, exporting trained classifiers, validating the results, and deploying as a REST service.  Syberia makes it easy to <strong>quickly clean up messy data</strong>, build <strong>produciton-ready predictive models</strong>, and quickly <strong>skip past the boring stuff and onto the interesting data analysis.</strong>

      Syberia files are created via a <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> generator.  To install Syberia, install Yeoman and the generator. 
    %pre 
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          brew install npm
          npm install -g yo
          npm install -g generator-syberia
    %p
      Now we can start creating a model!  Let's try to predict the chances of surviving the sinking of the RMS Titanic, via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">the Kaggle dataset</a>.
    %pre 
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          mkdir titanic
          cd titanic
          yo syberia
    %p
      To predict, we have to make a model.  We can do that with Yeoman.
    %pre
      = preserve do
        :escaped
          yo syberia:model
    %p
      We now have to write the model.  Let's do that real quickly.
